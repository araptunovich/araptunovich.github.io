                    Excalisoft was founded in 2009 as a company to facilitate the ambitions of the two original founders, Johan&Robin. To make games! And this is exactly what we’ve been doing ever since. With our team and partners growing over the years we’ve established a unique little corner of creativity with the goal to provide fun and unique games of high quality.

                    Even though we love all kinds of games and genres, the RPG and MMORPG genre have a special place in our heart. So we decided our first game should be an MMORPG and that’s how the 2D MMORPG, Sagramore, came to be. We really liked the English myths surrounding Excalibur, the legendary weapon, hence we decided that Sagramore should incorporate this. The name is an obvious reference for those in the know. In addition we, the members of the development team, each have each been “knighted” and properly nicknamed as such.

                    Our focus lies mainly on our favorite genres, but this has not kept us from creating games in entirely different genres. To find out exactly what these games are that we made, check out the “our games” area on the website!

                    As an Indie company our vision for game creation is one that starts with the team. We decide what we want to make based on what we like and if we like an idea, we make it. There is not much more to it than that.
